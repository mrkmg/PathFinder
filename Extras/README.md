PathFinder Extras
=============

A collection of projects to help with development.

## PathFinder.Benchmark

Used in development to benchmark changes.

## PathFinder.Console

Was used in early development to visually see how the solver was performing. Mostly
unused now, but still fun to tinker with. It can also be used to test a variety of
different "greedy factors" to see how they effect the total cost vs time to solve.

## PathFinder.Gui

This project is a simple GUI demo to show off the different path finding solvers 
included in PathFinder.

Run "PathFinderGui.Desktop" to get a simple generated world and try different
solvers with various options.

Plans for this project include adding more world generation options, 3d worlds, and 
more configuration for colors and visuals.

## PathFinder.DocFx

Generates the API Documentation using DocFx.

## SimpleWorld

A simple map generator for testing the path finding solvers.
