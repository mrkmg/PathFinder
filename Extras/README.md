PathFinder Extras
=============

A collection of projects to help with development.

## PathFinderBenchmark

Used in development to benchmark changes.

## PathFinderConsole

Was used in early development to visually see how the solver was performing. Mostly
unused now, but still fun to tinker with.

## PathFinderGui

This project is a simple GUI demo to show off the different path finding solvers 
included in PathFinder.

Run "PathFinderGui.Desktop" to get a simple generated world and try different
solvers with various options.

Plans for this project include adding more world generation options, 3d worlds, and 
more configuration for colors and visuals.

## SimpleWorld

A simple map generator for testing the path finding solvers.
