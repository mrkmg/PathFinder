# Path Finder

A simple to use collection of various path finding algorithms.

This is a work in progress. All API's are subject to change *significantly*.

## Installing

Currently Path Finder is not published to NuGet. Once it is a more
stable state, it will be published.

To use in an existing project, you only need the `PathFinder` project.

## Usage

1. Clone Path Finder to your machine.
2. Build `PathFinder`.
3. Add a reference in your existing project to `PathFinder.dll`.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a variety of easy to use and well
performing path finding algorithms that can be used with little to no 
modification of a projects existing code.
